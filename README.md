# Unconflow-PINN
The unconfined aquifer transient flow problem is solved by using PINN; PINNs accurately compute the time-varying phreatic surface and piezometric heads; PINNs have proven to be very effective in data-scarce environments; PINNs are a promising alternative to classical numerical methods in hydrogeology.
